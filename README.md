# What is amqp?
AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol12. It is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations
# What it means? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first quest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?
The first `guest` is the username, the second `guest` is the password for authentication, `localhost` is the hostname where the AMQP broker (like RabbitMQ) is running, and `5672` is the port on which the broker is listening

My queued nessage peaked at 15, and this queue happens because messages are being published faster than they can be consumed.
